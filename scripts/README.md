## üìã Prerequisites

Before running demos, ensure you have:

1. **Laravel Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   php artisan key:generate
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r lacity-ai/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database with Sample Data:**
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   # OR import real NYC 311 data:
   php artisan lacity:import-csv --file=storage/311-data.csv
   ```

4. **Vector Embeddings (for search demos):**
   ```bash
   php artisan lacity:generate-embeddings --type=all
   ```

5. **Laravel Server Running (for API demo):**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

## üéØ Demo Scenarios by Use Case

### For Developers Learning AI Integration
1. Start with **Emergency Complaint** demo to understand AI analysis workflow
2. Try **Semantic Search** to see vector embeddings in action
3. Explore **API Showcase** for integration patterns

### For Performance Testing
1. Run **Bulk Processing** with increasing batch sizes
2. Monitor system resources and processing times
3. Test queue workers and scaling patterns

### For Product Demonstrations
1. **Emergency Complaint** - Show real-time risk assessment
2. **Semantic Search Interactive** - Let audience try natural language queries  
3. **API Showcase** - Demonstrate integration capabilities

### For System Administration
1. **Bulk Processing** - Test system limits and performance
2. **API Showcase** - Verify all endpoints are working
3. Review logs and error handling

## üîß Configuration

Demos use your existing `.env` configuration. Key settings:

```env
# Required for AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Optional for Slack notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your-slack-webhook

# Database connection
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_DATABASE=laracity
```

## üìä Output and Metrics

All demos provide:
- **Real-time progress indicators**
- **Performance metrics and timing**
- **Success/failure rates**
- **Detailed error reporting**
- **System resource usage**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No embeddings found"**
```bash
php artisan lacity:generate-embeddings --type=all --batch-size=50
```

**"No complaints found"**
```bash
php artisan db:seed
# OR
php artisan lacity:import-csv --file=your-data.csv
```

**"OpenAI API quota exceeded"**
- Demos will show this as expected behavior
- System continues to work without AI features
- Check your OpenAI billing dashboard

**"Database connection failed"**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check `.env` database configuration
- Ensure pgvector extension is installed

### Performance Tips:

1. **For large datasets:** Use smaller batch sizes initially
2. **For faster demos:** Pre-generate embeddings before running search demos
3. **For API demo:** Ensure Laravel server is running and accessible

## üìö Educational Value
